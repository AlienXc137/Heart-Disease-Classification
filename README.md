# Heart Disease Classification using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project uses machine learning to classify heart disease based on medical data. It aims to assist in early detection and diagnosis, improving healthcare decision-making.

## Dataset
The model is trained on a dataset containing various health parameters such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more.

## Features
- Data preprocessing (handling missing values, scaling, feature selection)
- Multiple ML models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, etc.)
- Performance evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Visualizations for insights
